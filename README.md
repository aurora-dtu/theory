This repository holds Lean formalization of prior and ongoing work under the AuRoRA project.

The best way to explore the project is by visiting the [documentation](https://aurora-dtu.github.io/theory/) or reading one of the [publications](#Publications).

## Building the project

To build the project, one needs to install Lean. The recommended approach is to use VS Code as listed [here](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html). If you prefer the CLI, install [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and run `lake build`.

## Formalizations efforts

- **_Markov Decision Processes_ (MDP)** [[Docs](https://aurora-dtu.github.io/theory/MDP.html)]
    - Formalization of countably infinite branching MDP.
    - Optimal expected cost of MDPs.
    - Fixed point formalization of expected cost and relation to finitely branching MDPs.
    - Connecting different interpretations of optimal expected cost across optimization order and history-dependence.
- **_probabilistic Guarded Command Language_ (pGCL)** [[Docs](https://aurora-dtu.github.io/theory/PGCL.html)]
    - Definition of a variant of pGCL and its operational semantics.
    - The induced MDP of the operational semantics of pGCL to define the expected costs of programs.
    - Connecting the _Weakest Preexpectation_ (WP) of pGCL programs to the optimal expected cost of the induced operational MDP by way of least fixed points.
